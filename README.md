# Notes 2: Introducing Cloud Computing
## 2.1 A Brief History 

•	John McCarthy introduced the idea of “utility computing” in 1961 which was the first introduction to computing in the cloud. As well as Leonard Kleinrock mentioned in 1969. 

•	1990 Salesforce.com created the idea of “bringing remotely provisioned services into enterprise.”

•	2002 Amazon.com launched AWS.

•	“Cloud Computing” became an official term in 2006 but early similar terms were dated back in the 1990’s. 

•	Cloud Computing: is a specialized form of distributed computing that introduces utilization models for remotely provisioning scalable and measured resources. 

## 2.2 Business Drivers 

•	Being able to keep up with organizations demand for IT resources, products, and services became known as “Capacity Planning.” 

•	Different types of capacity planning strategies are Lead Strategy, Lag Strategy, and Match Strategy. 

•	Estimating a company’s usage is difficult and while trying to be consistent with value. 

•	The two costs to look out for are the cost of obtaining new infrastructure and the cost to maintain ownership. While overhead costs make up a good amount of the IT budget. 

•	The ability for an organization to respond to change is “Organizational Agility” and may be costly. 

## 2.3 Concepts & Terminology

•	The term “Cloud” is distinctly an IT environment that is used to connect remotely to measured IT resources. 

•	A cloud has finite boundary, is privately owned, and offers access to IT resources that is metered.

•	IT Resource: is a physical or virtual IT-related artifact that can be either software or hardware based.

•	An on-premise IT resource can access and interact with cloud-based IT, be moved to a cloud, and host redundant deployments of IT resources. 

## 2.4 Goals and Benefits

•	A cloud Measured usage or “as proportional” costs is represented as a feature that allows measured operational expenditures to replace anticipated capital expenditures. 

•	Measurable Benefits to cloud consumers: 
o	Pay-as-you-go computing resources for short-term and ability to discard when not needed any longer.
o	Reducing the need to prepare for provisioning due to unlimited computing resources.
o	Add and remove IT resources as well as modifying storage disk space. 
o	Abstraction of the infrastructure to be easily moved. 

•	IT resource with increased availability and reliability brings the ability to be accessible for longer periods of time and able to better avoid and recover from exception conditions. 

2.5 Risks and Challenges

•	With the expansion of trust boundaries, it can be difficult to establish a security architecture.

•	Limitation of data security for the cloud provider’s access. Creating overlapping trust boundaries and increased exposure of data to malicious cloud consumers.

## 2.6 From Google’s Perspective 

•	What is Google’s six key properties of cloud computing?
o	Cloud computing is user-centric, task centric, powerful, accessible, intelligent, and programmable.

## 2.7 From Amazons Perspective

•	What is Amazon’s six benefits to cloud computing? 
o	Trade capital expense for variable expense
o	Benefit from massive economies of scale 
o	Stop guessing capacity 
o	Increase speed & agility 
o	No money into running & maintaining data centers
o	Going global in Minutes 

## 2.9 Video 

•	Cloud Computing: Paradigm which allows for on-demand network access to shared computing resources. Model for managing, storing, & processing data online through internet. 

•	SAAS or Software as a Service – On-Demand Service, no need for installation, available for multiple users, cheap while managed by a vendor. 

•	PAAS or Platform as a Service - made up of programming language execution environment, operating system, and both web server & database. Users can build, compile, and run programs with no worries of infrastructure. User manages data and application resources while the rest of resources are managed by vendor. 

•	IAAS or Infrastructure As A Service – offers all computing resources in a virtual environment such as data storage, virtualization, servers & networking while these are managed by the vendor. User will be responsible for handling applications, data, runtime, & middleware. 

## 2.14 Cloud Computing Deployment Models 

•	Cloud Computing gives the ability to not have to worry about procurement, maintenance, and capacity planning.

•	Applications in the cloud are fully deployed and these apps have either been created in the cloud or migrated from an existing infrastructure. 

•	Hybrid deployment gives users the opportunity to extend, grow, and combine this between the cloud and exisiting on-premises infrastructure. 

•	For on-premises deployment provides dedicated resources but doesn’t provide much benefits. 

**Quotes: 

“When arranged in a pyramid form the delivery models follow in the order of SAAD, PAAS, & IAAS.” 

This will help to remember these three service models as “SPI” and the pyramid will allow me to continue to gain a remembrance of these three important concepts. 

“The most common economic rationale for investing in cloud-based IT sources is in the reduction of outright elimination of up-front IT investments, namely hardware and software purchases and ownership costs.” 

This is a valid and probably the most important convincing point into why cloud computing is so important to businesses and users whom are looking to expand into the cloud services.
